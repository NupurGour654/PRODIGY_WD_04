# PRODIGY_WD_04

This repository features my personal portfolio website, developed using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The site is designed to be fully responsive, providing a smooth and consistent experience across all screen sizes from desktops to mobile devices.

The website's structure is built with HTML, styled using CSS for a visually appealing and flexible layout, and enhanced with JavaScript to introduce interactivity and dynamic functionality.

This project serves as a **starter template** for building your own personalized portfolio. You can easily update the content to include your own information and showcase your work. The styling — including colors, fonts, and layout — can be customized via the CSS files. If you'd like to expand the site further, you can add new sections or features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Feel free to use this repository as a foundation for your personal portfolio and modify it to best represent your Skills, Personality, and Creative vision.
